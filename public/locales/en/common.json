    "question1": "What is the difference between apostille and embassy legalization?",
    "answer1": "Apostille is a simplified legalization process for countries that are part of the 1961 Hague Convention. Embassy legalization is required for countries that are not part of the convention and involves legalizing the document through the specific country's embassy or consulate.",
    "question2": "How long does the legalization process take?",
    "answer2": "The standard process typically takes 5-7 business days for apostille and 7-14 business days for embassy legalization. We also offer express services for urgent matters.",
    "question3": "What documents can be legalized?",
    "answer3": "We can help with the legalization of most types of documents, including academic certificates, birth certificates, marriage certificates, company documents, powers of attorney, and many other official documents.",
    "question4": "Do I need to send original documents?",
    "answer4": "Yes, original documents are usually required for legalization. In some cases, notarized copies may be accepted. Contact us for specific advice for your case.",
    "question5": "Can I track my order?",
    "answer5": "Yes, once your order has been confirmed, you will receive an order number that you can use to track the status of your order via our order status page.",
